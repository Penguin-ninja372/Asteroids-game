# Asteroids-game
An asteroids game that I created where you fire at rocks to earn points. I was inspired to complete this game and got to work with both the code and
pictures. I was not following a tutorial however and wanted to test my skills.


HOW TO PLAY
Press UP arrow to move forward.
Press LEFT and RIGHT arrows to turn left and right.
Press C to activate freeze mode (stop asteroid movement).
Press X to activate power mode (destroy asteroids in one hit rather than them splitting).

You cannot move backward!
